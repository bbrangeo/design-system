        <h3>BEM Naming</h3>
        <p>BEM is one of the methods of naming components — block, element, modifier. </p>
        <p>If you’re comfortable with BEM, move down to the “Where we diverge from BEM” section.</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar or who need a quick refresh, let’s briefly look at how BEM works. As an example, we'll build a button component.</p>
        <h4>Block</h4>
        <p>A block represents the main component name.
          In our example, if you were building a button component, the class name would be <code>.button</code>. All of the properties you want included for all buttons would be included in the base <code>.button</code> class.
          A block is an independent entity which must be able to be moved without affecting its appearance or its functioning.
        </p>

        <h4>Element</h4>

        <h4>Modifier</h4>
    </div>
  </main>
