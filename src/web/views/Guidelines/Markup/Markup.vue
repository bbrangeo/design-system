      <p class="bimdata-text">
        BEM is one of the methods of naming components — block, element,
        modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="bimdata-text">
        If you’re comfortable with BEM, move down to the “Where we diverge from
        BEM” section.
      </p>
      <p class="bimdata-text">
        For those unfamiliar or who need a quick refresh, let’s briefly look at
        how BEM works. As an example, we'll build a button component.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bimdata-h4">Block</h4>
      <p class="bimdata-text">
        A block represents the main component name. In our example, if you were
        building a button component, the class name would be
        <code>.button</code>. All of the properties you want included for all
        buttons would be included in the base <code>.button</code> class. A
        block is an independent entity which must be able to be moved without
        affecting its appearance or its functioning.
